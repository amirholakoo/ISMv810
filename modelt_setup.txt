Step 1: Create a Models Package
Instead of a single models.py file, you will create a models directory within your app to house multiple model modules.

Inside your Django app directory, create a new directory named models.
Remove the existing models.py file if it exists (make sure to backup any code inside it first).
Inside the models directory, create an __init__.py file. This file makes Python treat the directory as a package.
Step 2: Create Separate Model Modules
Inside the models directory, create separate Python files (modules) for different groups of models. For example, you might create trucks.py, suppliers.py, products.py, etc., each containing related models.

trucks.py

python
Copy code
from django.db import models

class Truck(models.Model):
    # Truck model definition...
suppliers.py

python
Copy code
from django.db import models

class Supplier(models.Model):
    # Supplier model definition...
Step 3: Import Models into __init__.py
To make your models accessible as if they were all defined in a single models.py file, import them into the __init__.py file within the models directory. This step is crucial for Django to recognize and work with your models correctly.

models/init.py
python
Copy code
from .trucks import Truck
from .suppliers import Supplier
from .products import Product
# Continue importing other models...
Step 4: Adjust Your Imports
Anywhere in your Django project that you previously imported models from the models.py file, you will need to adjust the import statements to reflect the new structure. The good news is that if you've followed step 3 correctly, the import statements in other parts of your project might not need to change, thanks to the imports in __init__.py.

For example, if you previously had:

python
Copy code
from myapp.models import Truck, Supplier
This import statement can remain the same, even after you've split the models into separate modules, thanks to the __init__.py imports.

Step 5: Migrations
After restructuring your models, run the following commands to make sure your new structure doesn't introduce any migration issues:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Django should handle this restructuring without any issues, as long as the models themselves haven't changed.
