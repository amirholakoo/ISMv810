### Step 2: Update and Upgrade Your System

It's a good practice to ensure your system's package list and installed packages are up to date. In your terminal, run:

bashCopy code

`sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade`

This process may take some time, depending on your internet connection and the number of updates available.

### Step 3: Install Python and Virtual Environment

Django is a Python-based framework, so you need Python installed. RPI4 usually comes with Python pre-installed, but let's ensure it's up to date.

1.  Install Python 3 and pip:

bashCopy code

`sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip`

1.  Install Virtualenv:

bashCopy code

`sudo pip3 install virtualenv`

Virtual environments allow you to manage Python packages for different projects separately.

### Step 4: Setting Up a Project Directory

Choose where you want to store your project files. It's common to use the home directory for simplicity.

1.  Navigate to the Home Directory:

bashCopy code

`cd ~`

1.  Create a New Directory for Your Project:

Replace `myproject` with whatever you want to name your project:

bashCopy code

`mkdir myproject
cd myproject`

### Step 5: Create a Virtual Environment

Inside your project directory, create a virtual environment to isolate your project's Python/Django packages.

bashCopy code

`virtualenv myprojectenv`

Activate the virtual environment:

bashCopy code

`source myprojectenv/bin/activate`

Your command prompt should now show the name of your virtual environment, indicating it's active.

### Step 6: Install Django

With the virtual environment activated, install Django using pip:

bashCopy code

`pip install django`

### Step 7: Start a Django Project

Create a new Django project with:

bashCopy code

`django-admin startproject myproject .`

The dot at the end creates the project in the current directory without adding an extra subdirectory.

### Step 8: Run the Development Server

Test if everything's set up correctly:

bashCopy code

`python manage.py runserver`

You should see a message indicating the development server is running. You can access the Django default welcome page by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` on your RPI4's web browser.

### Step 9: Accessing Django Admin

Before accessing the Django admin, you need to create a superuser.

1.  Create Superuser:

bashCopy code

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

Follow the prompts to set up a username, email, and password.

1.  Run the Server Again (if not running):

bashCopy code

`python manage.py runserver`

1.  Access Admin Site: Go to `http://localhost:8000/admin` and log in with the superuser account you just created.

Congratulations! You've set up a basic Django project on your RPI4. From here, you can start developing your application, defining models, and working on your inventory and sales management system. If you have any questions or need further instructions, feel free to ask!
